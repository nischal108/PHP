**Report: Implementation of Date Difference Calculator**

### **Introduction**
This project involves the design and implementation of a web application that calculates the difference in days between two dates entered by the user. The application integrates both client-side scripting (JavaScript) and server-side scripting (PHP) to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

---

### **Client-Side Implementation (JavaScript)**

1. **Real-Time Validation**:
   - JavaScript validates the date inputs in real-time using a regular expression (`YYYY-MM-DD` format).
   - Errors are displayed dynamically using the DOM to avoid page reloads.

2. **Loading Spinner**:
   - A loading spinner is displayed when the form is submitted to enhance user feedback.

3. **Cookies**:
   - JavaScript uses cookies to store the user's last entered dates.
   - On subsequent visits, the form fields are prefilled with these values for convenience.

4. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - Error messages and success messages are displayed dynamically using the DOM.
   - Form events (submission and reset) are handled using JavaScript.

5. **Bonus Feature**:
   - The last 5 date calculations are stored in a session and displayed using a `forEach` loop.

### **Server-Side Implementation (PHP)**

1. **Welcome Message**:
   - PHP displays a welcome message with the current date and time using the `date()` function.

2. **Processing Form Data**:
   - The two dates submitted via the form are processed, and the difference in days is calculated using the `strtotime()` function.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - PHP uses cookies to store the user's last entered dates and prefill them on subsequent visits.
   - Sessions are used to maintain a record of the last 5 calculations.

4. **Formatted Output**:
   - The entered dates, the calculated difference in days, and a list of the last 5 calculations are displayed neatly on the results page.

5. **Comments and Modularity**:
   - The PHP code is modular, with clear comments explaining the logic and purpose of each section.

### **Challenges and Solutions**

1. **Date Validation**:
   - Ensured consistent validation across both client and server using regular expressions and `strtotime()`.

2. **User Experience**:
   - Implemented real-time feedback and cookies to enhance usability and provide a personalized experience.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Used sessions to store the last 5 calculations, ensuring the data persists across page reloads without cluttering the user's browser storage.

### **Conclusion**
The project demonstrates a seamless integration of client-side and server-side scripting. By using JavaScript and PHP effectively, the application ensures accurate calculations, a user-friendly interface, and proper data management. Additional features like cookie-based data persistence and session-tracked history improve the application's overall functionality and user engagement.
